We are thrilled to announce the release of ThingsDB 1.5, bringing a plethora of exciting improvements and powerful new features to your data management experience.

## Enhanced Syntax and Structure:

* **Comments Everywhere:** Embed comments directly within your code for improved readability and maintainability.  
* **Stricter Syntax:** Enforced semicolon usage and stricter syntax checking ensure code clarity and consistency.  
* **Collection Management:** Collection IDs and root IDs can now differ, offering greater flexibility.  
* **Full Collection Exports:** Utilize the `dump` option in `export(..)` for comprehensive collection backups.  
* **Import Functionality:** Effortlessly restore collections using the new `import()` function.  
* **Collection Root Access:** The `root()` function provides direct access to the collection root.

## Improved Functionality:

* **Bug Fixes:** Resolved issues related to enumerators, relation application, async future errors, nesting tasks, and task ownership.  
* **Docker Image Updates:** Both test and build images have been upgraded for enhanced performance and compatibility.  
* **Mathematical Powerhouse:** Embrace a range of new mathematical functions like `abs()`, `cos()`, `log10()`, and more, along with constants like `MATH_E` and `MATH_PI`.  
* **Library Integration:** `libcleri` is now seamlessly integrated, eliminating the need for separate installation.  
* **Time Precision:** `new_backup()` and `new_token()` now exclusively accept timestamps for accurate time management.

## Expanded Capabilities:

* **Set Operators:** Leverage new operators like `<=`, `<`, `>=`, and `>` to perform comprehensive set comparisons.  
* **UTF-8 Enhancements:** Define UTF-8 type properties with improved range support using `<..>`.  
* **Bitwise Operations:** Perform bitwise operations using the NOT (`~`), Left Shift (`<<`), and Right Shift (`>>`) operators.  
* **Task Completion:** Repeating tasks now return `nil` upon successful completion.  
* **Error Correction:** A spelling error in the integer range error message has been rectified.  
* **Relation Enhancements:** Enforced restrictions for relations between non-stored sets and values.  
* **Future Closures:** The maximum number of future closure calls has been increased from 8 to 255\.

## Additional Refinements:

* **Consistent Return Values:** `mod_procedure(..)` now returns `nil` on success for consistency.  
* **Module Methods:** The `argmap` property is now mandatory for exposed module methods.  
* **Duplicate Node Prevention:** Adding nodes will now be checked based on the address and port, preventing duplicates.  
* **Efficient Shutdowns:** Uninitialized nodes no longer experience shutdown wait time.  
* **Improved User Experience:** New users and collections return their names instead of IDs, and empty collections are ignored during restore.  
* **Increased Limits:** The range function maximum has been expanded from 9999 to 100000\.
